<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>Hi, I'm Febin Francis! I'm a research student specializing in artificial intelligence with a keen interest in
  understanding and developing advanced neural networks.
  I hold a master's degree in AI and ML and enjoy applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems.
</p>
<p>When I'm not delving into the complexities of AI, I love driving and exploring new ways to combine my passion for
  technology and driving into a meaningful career.
</p>
<p>
  I thrive on solving problems by breaking them into manageable parts and am always eager to learn and grow.
